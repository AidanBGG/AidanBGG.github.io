            <b>Crown shyness</b> (also
            <i>canopy disengagement</i>
            ,<sup>[1]</sup>
            <i>canopy shyness</i>,
            <sup>[2]</sup> or
            <i>inter-crown spacing</i>)
            is a feature observed in some tree species, in which the crowns of 
            fully stocked trees do not touch each other, instead forming a 
            canopy with channel-like gaps.
            <sup>[4][5]</sup> 
            This is most prevalent among 
            trees of the same species, but also occurs between trees of 
            different species.
            <sup>[6][7]</sup> 
            There exist many hypotheses as to why 
            crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research suggests that 
            it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.
