            <b>Graphic design</b>
            is a profession,
            <sup>[2]</sup>
            academic discipline
            <sup>[3][4][5]</sup>
            and applied art whose activity consists in projecting visual 
            communications intended to transmit specific messages to social 
            groups, with specific objectives.
            <sup>[6]</sup>
            Graphic design is an
            interdisciplinary branch of design
            <sup>[1]</sup>
            and of the fine arts. Its practice involves creativity, innovation
            and lateral thinking using manual or digital tools, where it is
            usual to use text and graphics to communicate visually.

        <p>
            
            The role of the graphic designer in the communication process is
            that of encoder or interpreter of the message. They work on the
            interpretation, ordering, and presentation of visual messages.
            Usually, graphic design uses the aesthetics of typography and the
            compositional arrangement of the text, ornamentation, and imagery
            to convey ideas, feelings, and attitudes beyond what language alone
            expresses. The design work can be based on a customer's demand, a
            demand that ends up being established linguistically, either orally
            or in writing, that is, that graphic design transforms a linguistic
            message into a graphic manifestation.
            <sup>[7]</sup>

            Graphic design has, as a field of application, different areas of
            knowledge focused on any visual communication system. For example,
            it can be applied in advertising strategies, or it can also be
            applied in the aviation world
            <sup>[8]</sup>
            or space exploration.
            <sup>[9][10]</sup>
            In this sense, in some countries graphic design is related as only 
            associated with the production of sketches and drawings, this is 
            incorrect, since visual communication is a small part of a huge 
            range of types and classes where it can be applied.

            With origins in Antiquity and the Middle Ages,
            <sup>[11]</sup>
            design as applied art was initially linked to the boom of rise of
            printing in Europe in the 15th century and the growth of consumer
            culture in the Industrial Revolution. From there it emerged as a
            distinct profession in the West, closely associated with
            advertising in the 19th century
            <sup>[12]</sup>
            and its evolution allowed its consolidation in the 20th century.
            Given the rapid and massive growth in information exchange today,
            the demand for experienced designers is greater than ever,
            particularly because of the development of new technologies and the
            need to pay attention to human factors beyond the competence of the
            engineers who develop them.

            Due to its interdisciplinary nature, graphic design can be
            performed in different areas of application: branding, technical
            and artistic drawing, signage, photography, image and video editing,
            3D modeling, animation, programming, among other fields.

        <h3>Terminology</h3>

            William Addison Dwiggins is often credited with first using the 
            term "graphic design" in a 1922 article,
            <sup>[14]</sup>
            although it appears in a 4 July 1908 issue (volume 9, number 27) of
            Organized Labor, a publication of the Labor Unions of San Francisco,
            in an article about technical education for printers:
            <sup>[15]</sup>

            Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy branches 
            leads to "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees. Trees in windy 
            areas suffer physical damage as they collide with each other during 
            winds. As the result of abrasions and collisions, there is an 
            induced crown shyness response. Studies suggest that lateral branch 
            growth is largely uninfluenced by neighbours until disturbed by 
            mechanical abrasion.
            <sup>[10]</sup>
            If the crowns are artificially prevented from colliding in the 
            winds, they gradually fill the canopy gaps.
            <sup>[11]</sup>
            This explains instances of crown shyness between branches of the 
            same organism. Proponents of this idea cite that shyness is 
            particularly seen in conditions conducive to this pruning, 
            including windy forests, stands of flexible trees, and early 
            succession forests where branches are flexible and limited in 
            lateral movement. 
            <sup>[6][12]</sup>
            By this explanation, variable flexibility in lateral branches has a 
            large bearing on degree of crown shyness.
