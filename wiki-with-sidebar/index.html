                            Entombed is a Swedish death metal band formed in 1987 under 
                            the name of Nihilist. Entombed began their career as an early 
                            pioneer of Scandinavian death metal which initially differed 
                            from its American counterpart by its distinct "buzzsaw" guitar 
                            tone. However, by the early 1990s their sound had broadened to 
                            include garage rock and other influences. This new style would 
                            eventually be described as death 'n' roll. Entombed's main 
                            influences include bands such as Slayer, Celtic Frost, 
                            Repulsion, and Autopsy.
                            <sup>[1]</sup> 
                            Along with Dismember, Grave and Unleashed, Entombed has been 
                            referred to as one of the "big four" of Swedish death metal.

                        <p>

                            Entombed are rooted in the band Nihilist who were formed by 
                            drummer Nicke Andersson, guitarist Alex Hellid and bassist Leif 
                            Cuzner, who formed the band in 1987.
                            <sup>[3]</sup> 
                            After using a number of temporary vocalists for their initial 
                            shows, the band eventually recruited L.G. Petrov,
                            <sup>[3]</sup> 
                            who was the drummer for the band Morbid, which featured Mayhem 
                            vocalist Dead. The band also recruited Morbid's session 
                            guitarist Uffe Cederlund as a second guitarist, and recorded a 
                            number of demos with tracks that would eventually appear on 
                            Entombed's debut album.
                            <sup>[3]</sup> 
                            Following increased tensions between band members, the majority 
                            of the band decided to rename themselves as Entombed rather 
                            than force these members out.
                            <sup>[4]</sup>

                        </p>

                        <p>

                            Entombed's debut album <i>Left Hand Path</i> was released in 
                            1990,
                            <sup>[3]</sup> 
                            a cult favorite that established them as a popular Swedish 
                            death metal band.
                            <sup>[5]</sup> 
                            Left Hand Path and its follow-up, <i>Clandestine,</i>
                            <sup>[3]</sup> 
                            were unique in that they featured what was sometimes referred 
                            to as a "buzz saw" guitar sound.
                            <sup>[5]</sup> Prior to the recording of <i>Clandestine,</i> 
                            Petrov was fired from the band due to personal disputes.
                            <sup>[3]</sup> 
                            The vocals on the album were recorded by Andersson instead, and 
                            for the tour following the album's release in 1991, the band 
                            hired vocalist Johnny Dordevic, previously a member of the band 
                            Carnage.

                    Petrov eventually reconciled with the band after releasing an 
                    album with the band Comecon, and the band eventually released 
                    <i>Wolverine</i> Blues in 1993.
                    <sup>[3]</sup> 
                    The album featured a departure of sound from the band's 
                    previous work, with a greater influence of hard rock and heavy 
                    metal alongside their initial death metal stylings, in a style 
                    now often referred to as death 'n' roll.
                    <sup>[7][8]</sup> 
                    Although the release was divisive amongst the band's fanbase, 
                    it established their mainstream and critical reputation.
                    <sup>[9]</sup> 
                    Wolverine Blues is considered a classic of early 1990s death 
                    metal.

                    1998's <i>Same Difference</i> was the band's first album without 
                    drummer and founding member Nicke Andersson, who left the band 
                    to concentrate on his new project The Hellacopters.
                    <sup>[10]</sup> 
                    He was replaced by Peter Stjärnvind.
                    <sup>[10]</sup> 
                    In 2000, Entombed released <sup>Uprising</sup>,
                    <sup>[10]</sup>

                    <sup>[12]</sup>

                    Hellid, Andersson and Cederlund reunited to perform as Entombed 
                    in October 2016. They were joined by Robert Andersson (vocals) 
                    and Nicke Andersson's half brother Edvin Aftonfalk (bass), both 
                    formerly of the Swedish death metal band Morbus Chron. Their

                    November they performed a double set in Malmö to celebrate the 
                    25th anniversary of Clandestine, where the album was performed 
                    in its entirety twice. The first set was a performance by
